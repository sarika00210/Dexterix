**Voice for voiceless people **

WE ARE PROVIDING VOICE TO THE VOICELESS PEOPLES BY USING PYTHON PROGRAMING 
For example – lets suppose a dumb people come to you and he/ she knows how to communicate with the society with the help of sign language but u don’t know  sign  language the how will u going to understand the thoughts  of the dumb people ..

So by using our software in which we are installing our library regarding sign language .so if you put the sign showing by a person in area of interest which is a area in our software the our software will convert or predict that sign into words …so now you can easily  understand the thoughts of the person by using our software easily…….
